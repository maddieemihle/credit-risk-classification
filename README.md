# Credit Risk Analysis Report 

## Introduction 
The purpose of this analysis is to build and evaluate a machine learning model to predict loan risk. By using a logistic regression model, we aim to classify loans as either "healthy" (low risk) or "high-risk" based on historical data. This analysis will help the company make informed decisions about loan approvals.

## Overview of the Analysis

The dataset contained financial information about loans, such as loan amount, interest rate, and borrower information. The target variable, `loan_status`, was binary, with `0` representing healthy loans and `1` representing high-risk loans. The goal was to predict the `loan_status` variable, which indicates the risk level of a loan. The value counts for the target variable showed a significant class imbalance, with far more healthy loans than high-risk loans.

The machine learning process involved the following steps:
1. Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
2. Scaling the features to standardize the data.
3. Training a logistic regression model to classify loans as either healthy or high-risk.
4. Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

The logistic regression algorithm was chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in binary classification problems.

### Methods Used 
**1. Data Preprocessing:**
* The dataset was split into features (`X`) and labels (`y`).
* The data was divided into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` with a `random_state` for reproducibility.
* Features were standardized using a scaler to normalize the data and improve model performance.

**2. Machine Learning Model:**
* The Logistic Regression model was implemented for binary classification. 
* This algorithm was chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in predicting categorical outcomes.

**3. Model Evaluation:**
* Confusion Matrix: Used to evaluate the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
* Classification Report: Generated to calculate precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy for both classes (`0` for healthy loans and `1` for high-risk loans).


## Results
#### Machine Learning Model 1: Logistic Regression 
**Confusion Matrix Analysis:**
* Healthy Loans (`0`):
    * True Positives: 18,658
    * False Negatives: 107
    * The model performs exceptionally well in predicting healthy loans, with very few misclassifications.

* High-Risk Loans (`1`):
    * True Positives: 582
    * False Negatives: 37
    * The model is effective at identifying high-risk loans, though it misses a small number of them.

**Classification Report Analysis:**
* Precision:
    * For `low_risk` (0): 1.00 (perfect precision, no false positives).
    * For `high_risk` (1): 0.84 (some false positives, but still strong).

* Recall:
    * For `low_risk` (0): 0.99 (almost all healthy loans are correctly identified).
    * For `high_risk` (1): 0.94 (most high-risk loans are correctly identified).
    
* F1-Score:
    * For `low_risk` (0): 1.00 (excellent balance of precision and recall).
    * For `high_risk` (1): 0.89 (strong performance, though slightly lower than for healthy loans).

**Overall Performance:**
* Accuracy: 99% (The model is highly accurate overall).
* Macro Average: Indicates strong performance across both classes.
    * Precision (0.92)
    * Recall (0.97)
    * F1-Score (0.94) 
* Weighted Average: Precision, Recall, and F1-Score are all 0.99, reflecting the dominance of the `low_risk` class in the dataset.

## Summary
The logistic regression model performed exceptionally well, achieving high accuracy, precision, and recall for both healthy and high-risk loans. 

It excelled at predicting healthy loans (`0`) with near-perfect precision and recall. For high-risk loans (`1`), the model demonstrated strong performance, with a recall of 94%, meaning it identified most high-risk loans correctly. However, the slightly lower precision (84%) indicates some healthy loans were misclassified as high-risk.

Overall, the logistic regression model is recommended for use in credit risk classification. Its high accuracy and strong recall for high-risk loans make it a reliable tool for identifying risky loans. However, further improvements could focus on reducing false positives for high-risk loans to enhance precision. This would ensure fewer healthy loans are incorrectly flagged as high-risk, improving the model's overall utility for decision-making.
